## Troubleshooting

### Theme Issues

If you encounter hydration errors related to themes:

1. Run the `fix-theme-issues.bat` script to clear Next.js cache and restart the server
2. Clear your browser's localStorage and cache
3. Make sure your browser doesn't have any extensions that modify HTML/CSS

### Common React Hydration Errors

Hydration errors occur when the server-rendered HTML doesn't match what React expects during client-side hydration. Common causes:

- Server vs client differences in date/time formatting
- Random values that differ between renders
- Browser extensions modifying the DOM
- Theme inconsistencies between server and client

Solution: We've added `suppressHydrationWarning` attributes to elements that might cause hydration issues, and used proper mounting checks for client-side only features like theme toggling.
