# Hydration Issues Fix for BrainiFi LMS

This document outlines the changes made to address React hydration issues in the BrainiFi LMS app.

## What are hydration issues?

Hydration issues occur when the initial HTML rendered by the server doesn't match the HTML that React expects to generate on the client. This is particularly problematic with attributes like `fdprocessedid` that are added by browser extensions after initial server rendering.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Next.js Configuration Update

Updated `next.config.mjs` to remove problematic attributes during production builds:

```javascript
compiler: {
  // Suppress hydration warnings for specific attributes
  reactRemoveProperties: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { properties: ['^fdprocessedid$'] } : false,
}
```

### 2. Added Client-Side Hydration Fix

Created a component and script to clean up attributes that cause hydration mismatches:

- `components/HydrationFix.jsx`: React component that removes `fdprocessedid` attributes
- `public/scripts/suppress-hydration-warnings.js`: Client-side script that removes these attributes on load

### 3. Custom UI Components

Created UI components that handle hydration issues properly:

- `components/ui/Button.jsx`: Custom button component with proper hydration handling
- `components/ui/Alert.jsx`: Alert component with hydration fixes

### 4. Updated Form Components

Modified form components to prevent hydration issues:

- Added `data-suppress-hydration-warning` attribute to form elements
- Ensured controlled components have proper initial state values
- Fixed navigation issues in the Flashcard component

### 5. Custom Document Setup

Added a custom document with hydration mitigations through `pages/_document.js`

## Deployment Instructions

1. Run the deployment check script:

   ```
   node scripts/deployment-check.js
   ```

2. If the check passes, deploy to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter hydration issues:

1. Check browser console for specific component warnings
2. Look for form elements that might be affected by browser extensions
3. Ensure all form inputs are properly controlled components with initial state values
4. Add `suppressHydrationWarning` to specific components where needed
